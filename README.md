### ‚≠ê Featured Projects


#### 1)  Efficient Kernel Large-Margin Classifiers with Exact Cross-Validation Error Computation in PyTorch
- Developed TorchSVM, a PyTorch-based library that efficiently trains kernel SVMs and computes exact leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) errors with GPU acceleration.
- Achieved scalable and fast computation, reducing the cost of LOOCV to that of training a single SVM, making large-scale kernel classification practical.
- Benchmarked superior performance against existing solvers (e.g., LibSVM, scikit-learn), with significant improvements in speed and scalability.
- **Repo**: [torchsvm](https://github.com/YikaiZhang95/torchsvm)
- **Docs**: [torchsvm](https://pypi.org/project/torchsvm/)

#### 2) Finite Smoothing Algorithm for High-Dimensional Support Vector Machines and Quantile Regression
- Introduced a finite smoothing algorithm (FSA), a novel approach to tackle computational challenges in applying support vector machines (SVM) and quantile regression to high-dimensional data.
- Implemented FSA using the coordinate descent method and demonstrated that FSA significantly outpaces its competitors in speed, often by orders of magnitude, while maintaining or improving precision.
- Developed twoopen-source R packages: hdsvm for high-dimensional SVM and hdqr for high-dimensional quantile regression.
- **Repo**: [FSA](https://github.com/YikaiZhang95/hdsvm)
- **Paper**: [FSA](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=RvwMTDYTOb)
